- Here is the webGL build index.html file and TemplateData/style.css file. This styling creates a background on the website that makes the game look better. If using a different version of unity you might have to rewrite the html yourself. Can use these for reference if that is the case. Note that every time Unity builds, it rewrites these files so you'll have to manually overwrite them for each build (for prod)
